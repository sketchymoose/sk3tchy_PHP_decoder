sk3tchy_PHP_decoder
===================

PHP Script which allows a user to loop through multiple iterations of  gz_inflate and base64_decode.

Simply paste the PHP code snippet into the variable $OriginalFile so it looks like this:

$originalFile='eval(gzinflate(base64_decode("DZV<lotsMoreBase64Here>f//+7/8=")));';

Then... let that puppy run! :-)
